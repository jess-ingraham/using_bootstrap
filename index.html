        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p> Emily's Diner was first founded by Grandma Emily, as she was known to the town. She started the diner when people began asking her for recipes and regularly coming to her house for food. She started the diner out of her own kitchen as a delivery service until she saved up enough money to buy the building Emily's Diner is in today. Much of the building has been perserved, as well as the recipes, as well as it could. Some renovation has been done over time but we have stayed true to Grandma Emily. We are family owned and understand the importance of building relationships...especially through food.

        <p>I used to go to Emily's Diner every Saturday for dinner when I was a kid. When I moved away to college, I missed that family tradition. Not only does the diner have delicious food, but the whole restaurant, including the staff, is so homey. I cannot wait to go back when I visit home.</p>
